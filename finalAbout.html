  <p id="info">The inspiration of Restaurants and Rights comes from the feeling of never knowing where you want
    to eat even though you're hungry. To show our support for the community, all of the listed restaurants are
    LGBTQ+ friendly and promote a space of acceptance and unity. The listed restaurants are all local, ensuring only a short drive to your next meal and support for our nearby businesses.</p>
