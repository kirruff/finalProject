<p id="info">The inspiration of Restaurants and Rights comes from the feeling of never knowing where you want
to eat even though you're hungry. To show our support for the community, all of the listed restauarants are
LGBTQ+ friendly to promote a safespace of acceptance and unity. The listed restaurants are also all local,
ensuring only a short drive away from your next meal as well as putting money back into the hard-working community.</p>
